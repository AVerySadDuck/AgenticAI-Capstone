    "# Basic Ticketing System Agent Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a basic example of how to create a LangChain agent that interacts with the Bean Machine Ticketing System's OpenAPI specification. It demonstrates how to use LangChain's OpenAPI integration to build an agent that can reason over the API and make calls to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also includes examples of how to connect to a websocket endpoint and how to import the support information into a retrieval system. The notebook is designed to be a *_starting point_* for building a more advanced agent that can handle the requirements of the capstone project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this notebook as a starting point for your own agent development, adapting it to your specific needs and extending its functionality as required. Or you can take inspiration from it and build your own agent from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- Using websockets to connect to a ticketing system.\n",
    "- Retrieving and processing the OpenAPI specification.\n",
    "- Creating a simple agent that can interact with the ticketing system.\n",
    "- Importing the support information into a chroma vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start the Ticketing System\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure that the ticketing system is running. You can do this by following the instructions in the capstone project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Dependencies\n",
    "Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:"
