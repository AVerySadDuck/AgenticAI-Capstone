AI used to simplify Agent Prompts so not too much information going on
Tried to use AI to get better endpoints, context and memory but I spent about 3 hours and things just got more broken so I decided to stick with a Minimal Viable Product Proof of Concept
Would have been cool for testing to make automatic customers and responses in a round robin until it was resolved to test the full scope of things

What would I do next?!?!
Make the website update when details change, tried to mess around with the code but AI just kept breaking it
Cleaned up the code, better integrate things, do better code practices
Live updates for code on website, better endpoints, add the serial number stff
